### Version History

Version 1.1.0 (3/21/25)
- Changes/Additions
  ~ Added grid based system for moving the robot
- Current State
  ~ Auton starts slow, time in between moving to position is also slow (requires an inertial sensor)
- Notes
  ~ Slow start is most likely due to calculations taking time to run. Currently working on a fix for this.
